    <p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other
        one meaning. Fluff that up. It's important to me that you're happy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth.</p>

    <p>You need the dark in order to show the light. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.</p>

    <p>Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Trees grow however makes them happy. Very easy to work these to death</p>
    <p>
        And right there you got an almighty cloud. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Put it in, leave it alone. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
